# Time-Crisis-CLASSIFIED
A fast-paced arcade-style gameplay mod for Classic DOOM, powered by LZDOOM.
## What is Time Crisis CLASSIFIED?
Growing up playing video games of all kinds, it was second nature for me to use this media to express my passion for gaming, including the good old days of playing in the arcades. One such game is "Time Crisis", which I've been playing whenever I can. Having personally played the latest game in the series, it saddens me that no gameplay mod for Classic DOOM somewhat matches the feel of playing a "Time Crisis" arcade game.

That's where this mod comes in...
## The Story
For many years, the VSSE (Vital Situation Swift Execution) has been protecting the world from multiple factions out to create worldwide chaos, ranging from rogue militias to criminal syndicates. With its best Agents, the world can live in peace, knowing that even a single bullet from an Agent's pistol can prevent a potentially apocalyptic plot.

However, amongst the many operations of the VSSE, there exists one operation that the agency kept in secrecy. One that was deemed "unusually weird", even by VSSE's strict standards, and was considerably labeled a "Highly-Classified Operation"... until now!

The name of this classified mission: **Operation Ragnarok**.

This is the story of a pair of unlikeliest of heroes who are forced into a race against time to stop a sinister plot that could decide the fate of the world... whether they like it or not!
## Features
* **DOUBLE THE AGENTS, DOUBLE THE FUN:** Play as the "Bullet Prince" of FPS gaming Clyde Aarons, or the determined athletic Lisanna Exton, as they take down the Wild Child and their insurmountable army in hopes of stopping their secret weapon from wrecking havoc upon the world.
* **BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS:** Facing overwhelming odds, our two heroes weren't as outgunned as their enemies. From the trusty Pistol to the powerful Grenade Launcher, every weapon has its strengths and weaknesses, so use them wisely.
* **MAKE EVERY SECOND COUNT:** You are in a race against time itself as _something_ is been targeting our heroes, ensuring their demise, the world in chaos be damned. Be sure to keep your finger on the trigger and make sure every shot counts, for your time is short...
